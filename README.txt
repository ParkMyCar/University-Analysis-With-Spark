**READ ME**

This is an application built using Java and the Spark software package. It's purpose is to help the average person get access to the wealth
of information that is released publicly by the government about Universities in the United States.

After pulling down the Java source from GitHub you must also get the data set from Google Drive.

Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByPBNVyL61YYay1GdUtjYXJTUFE

The data set is hosted on Google drive because these files don't need to be tracked as they do not get changed and GitHub has bandwith limits 
when you're on a free account.vGoogle Drive does not have bandwith limits and I assume would maybe have some faster download speeds then GitHub.

Once you download all of the CSV files, place them in the src -> main -> resources directory

If you have Spark and Maven installed on your System, you should be able to run Main.java and be good to go!

*FUTRUE PLANS*
The end goal of this application is to get it launched on a webpage where any person could access this data without having to know anything
about Java or Spark. Right now I plan to get all of the back end settled before I try to tackle anything with the front end. Being a student
and an athlete time is limited but I would love to eventually achieve my end goal as I believe it would be a great tool for people going 
through the college selection process.
